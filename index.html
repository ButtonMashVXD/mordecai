<p>Custom-built full text geoparsing. Extract all the place names from a piece of
text, resolve them to the correct place, and return their coordinates and
structured geographic information.</p>

<p>This software was donated to the Open Event Data Alliance by Caerus Associates.
See <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/mordecai/releases">Releases</a> for the
2015-2016 production version of Mordecai.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-mordecai" class="anchor" href="#why-mordecai" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Mordecai?</h2>

<p>Mordecai was developed to address several specific needs that previous text
geoparsing software did not. These specific requirements include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overcoming a strong preference for US locations in existing geoparsing
software. Mordecai makes determining the country focus of the text should
be a separate and accurate step in the geoparsing process.</li>
<li>Ease of setup and use. The system should be installable and usable by people
with only basic programming skills. Mordecai does this by running as a Docker

<ul>
<li>REST service, hiding the complexity of installation from end users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drop-in replacement for <a href="http://cliff.mediameter.org/">CLIFF</a>/
<a href="https://clavin.bericotechnologies.com/">CLAVIN</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata">Open Event Data
Alliance</a> event data pipeline.</li>
<li>Ease of modification. This software was developed to be used primarily by
social science researchers, who tend to be much more familiar with Python
than Java. Mordecai makes the key steps in the geoparsing process (named entity
extraction, place name resolution, gazetteer lookup) exposed and easily
changed.</li>
<li>Language-agnostic architecture. The only language-specific components of
Mordecai are the named entity extraction model and the word2vec model. Both
of these can be easily swapped out, giving researchers the ability to
geoparse non-English text, which is a capability that has not existed in open
source software until now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h2>

<p><code>Mordecai</code> accepts text and returns structured geographic information extracted
from it. It does this in several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE">MITIE</a> named entity recognition to
extract placenames from the text. In the default configuration, it uses the
out-of-the-box MITIE models, but these can be changed out for custom models
when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses <a href="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/">word2vec</a>'s models, with
<a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a>'s Python implementation, to infer
the country focus of an article given the word vectors of the article's
placenames.  The word2vec vectors of all the place names extracted from the
text are averaged, and this average vector is compared to the vectors for all
country names. The closest country is used as the focus country of the piece of
text.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses a country-filtered search of the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">geonames</a>
gazetteer in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>
(with some custom logic) to find the latitude and longitude for each place
mentioned in the text.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It runs as a Flask-RESTful service inside a Docker container.</p>

<h2>
<a id="simple-docker-installation" class="anchor" href="#simple-docker-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simple Docker Installation</h2>

<p>Mordecai is built as a series of <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers,
which means that you won't need to install any software except Docker to use
it. You can find instructions for installing Docker on your operating system
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First download models to wherever you like (for this example
<code>./data</code>):</p>

<pre><code>bash data/fetch_models.sh
</code></pre>

<p>To start Mordecai locally, run these three commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo docker run -d -p 9200:9200 --name=elastic openeventdata/es-geonames
sudo docker build -t mordecai .
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v PATH/TO/data:/usr/src/data --link elastic:elastic mordecai 
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="explanation" class="anchor" href="#explanation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Explanation:</h3>

<p>The first code block downloads the pre-built word2vec and MITIE models that
Mordecai needs.</p>

<p>In the second block, the first line downloads (if you're running it for the
first time) and starts a pre-built image of a Geonames Elasticsearch container.
This container holds the geographic gazetteer that Mordecai uses to associate
place names with latitudes and longitudes. It will be accessible on port 9200
with the name <code>elastic</code>.</p>

<p>Line 2 builds the main Mordecai image using the commands in the <code>Dockerfile</code>.
This can take up to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Line 3 starts the Mordecai container and tells it to connect to our already
running <code>elastic</code> container with the <code>--link elastic:elastic</code> option. Mordecai
will be accessible on port 5000. By default, Docker runs on 0.0.0.0, so any
machine on your network will be able to access it. It also maps the directory
containing the word2vec and MITIE models to <code>/src/user/data</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note on resources</strong>: Many of the required components for <code>mordecai</code>,
including the word2vec and MITIE models, are very large so downloading and
starting the service takes a while. After starting the service, it will not be
responsive for several minutes as the models are loaded into memory. You should
also ensure that you have approximately 16 gigs of RAM available.</p>

<h2>
<a id="advanced-configuration" class="anchor" href="#advanced-configuration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced Configuration</h2>

<p><code>Mordecai</code>'s Geonames gazeteer can either be run locally alongside Mordecai or
on a remote server. Elasticsearch/Geonames requires a large amount of memory,
so running it locally may be okay for small projects (if your machine has
enough RAM), but is not recommended for production. </p>

<p>If you're running elasticsearch/geonames on a different server, you'll need to
make two change:</p>

<p>First, the config file's default settings assume that <code>es-geonames</code> is running
locally. If you're running it on a separate server, uncomment and change the
<code>Server</code> section of the config file and update with the IP and port of your
running geonames/elasticsearch index.</p>

<p>Second, leave out the <code>--link elastic:elastic</code> portion when you call <code>docker
run</code> on Mordecai.</p>

<p>If you make any modifications to the Python files, you'll need to rebuild the
Mordecai container, which should only take a couple seconds, and then relaunch
it.</p>

<p>The Mordecai Flask service runs with default values, but you can change them in
the Dockerfile or using environmental variables if you need it to use a
different port, host, etc. The options are described here:</p>

<pre><code>usage: app.py [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-p PORT] [-eh ELASTICSEARCH_HOST]
              [-ep ELASTICSEARCH_PORT] [-w W2V_MODEL] [-md MD] [-mn MITIE_NER]

Mordecai Geolocation

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Specify path to config file.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Specify port to listen on.
  -eh ELASTICSEARCH_HOST, --elasticsearch-host ELASTICSEARCH_HOST
                        Specify elasticsearch host.
  -ep ELASTICSEARCH_PORT, --elasticsearch-port ELASTICSEARCH_PORT
                        Specify elasticsearch port.
  -w W2V_MODEL, --w2v-model W2V_MODEL
                        Specify path to w2v model.
  -md MD, -mitie-dir MD
                        Specify MITIE directory.
  -mn MITIE_NER, --mitie-ner MITIE_NER
                        Specify path to MITIE NER model.
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="endpoints" class="anchor" href="#endpoints" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Endpoints</h2>

<p>Each of these endpoints will return example usage with a <code>GET</code> request.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><code>/country</code></p>

<p>In: text</p>

<p>Out: An ISO country code that best matches the country focus of the text (used as input to later searches). In the future, this will be a list of country codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/places</code></p>

<p>In: text, country code</p>

<p>Out: list of dictionaries of placenames and lat/lon in text. The keys are "lat", "lon", "placename", "searchterm", "admin1", and "countrycode". </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/osc</code></p>

<p>In: text</p>

<p>Out: placenames and lat/lon, customized for OSC stories</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="example-usage" class="anchor" href="#example-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example usage</h2>

<p>The primary intended use for Mordecai is to geocode events produced by the
<a href="https://github.com/openeventdata">Open Event Data Alliance</a> set of event
coding tools. These tools extract and structure descriptions of political
events from news text. The main
<a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/phoenix_pipeline">pipeline</a> takes in text
documents and <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/stanford_pipeline">their CoreNLP
parses</a>, extracts events
from them using <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2">Petrarch2</a>,
geolocates them (using Mordecai), and does some
<a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/phoenix_pipeline">postprocessing</a>.</p>

<p>The code integrating Mordecai into the pipeline can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/phoenix_pipeline/blob/master/geolocation.py">here</a>
and is a useful starting point for integrating Mordecai into other production
pipelines. The examples below demonstrate more basic useage in bash/curl,
and R, and Python.</p>

<h3>

<h2>
<a id="customization" class="anchor" href="#customization" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customization</h2>

<p>Mordecai is meant to be easy to customize. There are a few ways to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change the MITIE named entity recognition model. This is a matter of changing one line in the configuration file, assuming that the custom trained MITIE model returns entities tagged as "LOCATION".</p></li>
<li><p>Custom place-picking logic. See the <code>/osc</code> for an example. Prior knowledge about the place text is about and the vocabulary used in the text to describe place times can be hard coded into a special endpoint for a particular corpus.</p></li>
<li><p>If a corpus is known to be about a specific country, that country can be passed to <code>places</code> to limit the search to places in that country.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="tests" class="anchor" href="#tests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tests</h2>

<p><code>mordecai</code> currently includes a few unit tests. To run the tests:</p>

<pre><code>cd resources
py.test
</code></pre>

<p>The tests currently require access to a running Elastic/Geonames service to
complete. If this service is running locally in a Docker container, uncomment
the <code>Server</code> section in the config file so host = <code>localhost</code> and port =
<code>9200</code>.</p>
